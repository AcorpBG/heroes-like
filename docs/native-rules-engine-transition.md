# Moving the rules engine to C++: transition plan

Status: approved by the owner on 2026-10-20 with decisions D1-D3 (section 8). Phase 0 is done and the owner passed
gate G0 on 2026-10-20: Phase 1 starts with decisions D5, D6, D8 and D10 made, and Phase A runs alongside. Later phases
start only through their gates. Line references are as of commit 50929125a; each slice brief re-checks them.

## 1. Why, and what "done" means

- **Goal.** AI-vs-AI games an order of magnitude cheaper, so balance work can use 600-6,000 full games per change and
  genetic algorithms can use tens of thousands of games or millions of battles.
- **Today, measured** after the round-2 speed-up: 60 large 4P games took 29 minutes at 16 at once (on 50929125a) and
  40 minutes at 10 at once (round 7, on 7fa4a228d), both recorded in PLAN.md. That is about 7-8 slot-minutes per game,
  since batch games run to day 107-320. At that rate 600 games take about 5-7 h and 6,000 about 2-3 days on this
  machine, which also becomes barely usable at 16 at once.
- **Battles today.** The battle-AI tuner (`tools/battle_ai_arena`, already a generation-by-generation weight search)
  plays its 480-battle `standard` suite in about 75 s on 24 workers (`tools/battle_ai_arena/README.md:58`).
- **Not a second simulator.** C++ *replaces* the GDScript, one subsystem at a time. Main always holds one copy of
  every rule; the game, the match runner, the battle tuner and any command-line tool run the same native code.
- **End state.**
  - **Native** (`aurelion::rules`, a pure C++ core in a new `aurelion_rules` GDExtension for Windows and Linux): battles,
    battle AI, battle payloads, the overworld AI faction turn, day processing, and the human-side rule actions.
  - **GDScript keeps:** UI and scenes, `describe_*` text built on native queries, SaveService file I/O, ContentService
    parsing (feeding the native content tables), the map editor.
  - **Unchanged contracts:** save version 9 (`SessionStateStore.gd:4`), the session Dictionary shape, the battle RNG
    stream format.
  - **AI tuning numbers** live in content JSON, per controller, so tuning them never needs a C++ build.

## 2. Scope

A match executes at most about 42k GDScript lines per day (a reachability trace, an upper bound; Phase 0 records what
actually runs):

| Part | Lines | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Battle core | about 15k | BattleRules (10.1k reachable of 16.2k), BattleAiRules 3.7k, battle parts of SpellRules 0.9k, BattleAutoResolve, footprint, damage, town battle |
| Overworld AI | about 11k | AiHeroRules 6.4k, EnemyAdventureRules 3.8k, EnemyTurnRules 0.8k |
| Day processing and shared rules | about 16k | OverworldRules 9.1k reachable, HeroCommand, Artifact, HeroProgression, Scenario, town development, water travel, transit |
| Text built during the day | about 2.8k | `end_turn` builds message text even in headless matches |

How often it changes (commits since 2026-09-01): the rules layer was rebuilt until Oct 10 and has been quiet since
(7 commits after Oct 11, all alongside AI work). The AI is the hot spot: AiHeroRules is 13 days old with 43 commits.
Balance mostly lives in content JSON (33 content commits since Oct 1). All 22 unit ability ids are named in code, so a
*new* ability is a code change. The battle code has no `pow`, `exp`, `log` or `sqrt` at all.

## 3. Rules for every phase

1. **One copy on main.** During a slice, the GDScript reference lives only on the slice's branch behind a
   `HEROES_NATIVE_<SUBSYSTEM>=gdscript|native|shadow` switch. The merge switches every caller and deletes the replaced
   GDScript. Deleting it is an exit criterion (the RMG precedent: `RandomMapGeneratorRules.gd` is still used).
2. **Port semantics, not a redesign** (`docs/lessons-learned.md`, lesson 3). Keep Dictionary key order, int/float typing,
   sort tie order, the order of float operations, and per-call-site defaults. Typed rewrites, deterministic math and
   merging duplicate code (for example the AI's own damage estimate, `BattleAiRules.gd:2492-2567`) come later, each as a
   separate behaviour commit with owner approval and a new baseline.
3. **Fix the first function that differs**, found at the finest checkpoint (per call, then per action, then per day).
   After three failed fixes on the same function, stop and name it as a blocker in PLAN.md. Never tune toward win ratios.
4. **Bugs found while porting** are recorded by name and fixed in their own commit, never inside a port commit.
5. **Progress means native code runs the game.** Digest tools, corpora and switches are support work and land only with
   the slice that uses them (AGENTS.md "Implementation progress discipline").
6. **Speed claims are measured only:** plain runs, HEAD against the change, same concurrency, idle machine, in the binary
   flavour batches actually load. Estimates in this document are bounds, never promises.
7. **Pure, thread-safe core:** no mutable globals, caches per engine instance, read-only content tables (the map
   generator's pattern, `h3maped_rmg_core.cpp:58-87`).
8. **No builds, parity runs or timing while an owner batch is running.** Builds go to the Linux server or CI at low
   priority; batches run from a frozen copy of `bin/` so a sync never hits a locked DLL.

## 4. Architecture shared by all phases

**Code layout.** `src/gdextension/rules/` builds once as a static/object library and links into the `aurelion_rules`
GDExtension (its own `rules.gdextension`), `rules_selftest`, and later `battle_sim_cli`. Keeping it out of the map
persistence library means rules commits never rebuild the 45k-line `h3maped_rmg_core.cpp` (today compiled three times,
`src/gdextension/CMakeLists.txt:49-68`) or recommit the map generator binaries.

**Engine-exact helpers** (`rules/compat/`), copied from Godot 4.6.2 and each landed with the first slice that needs it:
PCG32 seed/state and `randi_range`, `randf` (which very likely returns a 32-bit float that GDScript widens; obstacles
test `rng.randf() < 0.4`, `BattleRules.gd:9403`), `String.hash`, `SortArray` tie order, `round` (half away from zero),
`posmod`, `snappedf`, `str()` of numbers, int64 wraparound. Each is fuzzed against the engine (at least 1M inputs)
before it is trusted. Seeds built from Variant `hash([...])` (`BattleRules.gd:15444`, `AiHeroRules.gd:1303, 1433`)
stay computed in GDScript, so the Variant hash may never need copying. Memo keys built from `hash()` only need the same
hit/miss behaviour.

**C++ determinism checklist.** `int64_t` everywhere (`long` is 32-bit on Windows); no locale-dependent functions
(`std::to_string(double)`, `printf("%f")`, `strtod`, `tolower`), ASCII-only lowering; no `unordered_*` iteration or
`std::hash` reaching any output; no behaviour depending on `DEBUG_ENABLED` (godot-cpp makes it public in
`template_debug`); `/fp:precise`, `-ffp-contract=off`, no fast-math, no `-march=native`; checked division; every
exception caught at the adapter. Numbers become text only in the Godot adapter, through godot-cpp `String::num`/`JSON`.

**Content.** A native content table is built once per content revision from the Dictionaries ContentService has already
parsed (no second JSON parser), keeping first-id-wins, file order and per-field presence (defaults differ per call
site). Genetic-algorithm overrides go through one in-memory override layer *in ContentService* that bumps the content
revision, so GDScript and native code never see two different contents in one match. Overrides are validated (no zero
hit points, reversed damage ranges and similar) at that boundary.

**State.** The session Dictionaries stay the save and UI format throughout. Native calls convert in, compute on a copy,
and write back only on success: known keys in place, new keys appended in GDScript's order, int/float types kept, array
identity kept (29 `is_same()` uses), unknown keys carried through. After each write-back a listed set of session-meta
caches is cleared (for example `_resolved_lookup_entry` assumes `resolved_encounters` only grows in place,
`OverworldRules.gd:3376-3398`). On failure the call returns `{ok: false, error}` and leaves the session untouched, so the
game can still save.

**Build and binaries.** The rules target compiles at `/O2 /Ob2` (`-O2` on GCC) in both flavours (batches load the
`template_debug` library, today `/Ob1`). The Linux debug `.so` is stripped; PDBs and Linux debug info are archived
outside git per build id. A repo script replaces the remote Linux build procedure that today exists only in the owner's
notes. Native slices run one at a time, because committed binaries conflict between branches. A new `.gdextension`
needs one `--headless --import` in every checkout; the runner and tuner check `ClassDB.class_exists` and fail loudly.
Release export excludes the rules debug library, `rules_selftest` and `battle_sim_cli` (`export_presets.cfg:10,34`),
and the release-candidate build (`tools/build_release_candidate.py`) builds and tests the rules library on both systems.

**Debugging.** An input-capture switch dumps each native call's input to a ring buffer written out on error or crash;
the input replays in `rules_selftest` or the CLI. ASan/UBSan builds of the CLI and self-test run on the Linux server.
Every match and tuner record carries the native build id, content hash and override hash, so results can be reproduced.

## 5. The standing parity check

1. **Corpus (committed):** the six seed setups with exact seed strings (large 4P one and two levels, large 4P with water
   on two levels, medium 3P with water, medium 3P on two levels, small 2P); the tuner's `standard` and `holdout` suites;
   about 200 battle payloads whose fixtures carry their own content rows (so balance edits to `units.json` do not break
   them); a scripted human-seat corpus that drives the public player APIs with turn playback on; and "save on day N, load,
   continue" for every phase (JSON load turns numbers into floats, which no AI match exercises).
2. **Digest:** a canonical serialization that keeps insertion order and int/float types, full float precision, timing
   fields left out (`tests/ai_versus_ai_match_report.gd:159, 171-173`), fixed map sections once on day 0, changing
   sections daily, plus the match record. Sorted output is only for reporting where it differs.
3. **`tools/rules_parity.py`:** finds the first differing day, replays to it with a full dump and reports the first
   differing path.
4. **When:** every port or speed change on Windows (HEAD against change); once on Linux per native change; the payload
   corpus gives identical bytes under MSVC, GCC 13.3 and MinGW/Wine. `rules_selftest` (helper vectors and "two runs are
   equal") joins `tools/core_suite.py`.
5. **Behaviour changes** record a new baseline in the same commit, with owner approval.

## 6. Phases

The sizes in "Totals" are the proposal's unmeasured guesses, not a schedule. Phase 0, guessed at 6-12 agent-days,
took 2 h 20 min from the start to both slices on main, two sessions in parallel (3 h 20 min with the review fixes). The
first Phase 1 slice measures the porting rate; G1 and G3 re-plan from it, and only measured times are quoted. The
whole-game gain of porting a part is bounded by `1 / (1 - share of match CPU it removes)`, filled in from the Phase 0
profile. Large whole-game gains come only once the AI, day processing *and* the fixed cost per match are native.

### Phase 0: measure, decide, prove the pipeline

- **Cheap levers first, all GDScript, each proven with identical digests:**
  - Run batches on the release export template instead of the editor binary (batches use
    `Godot_v4.6.2-stable_win64_console.exe`, `tools/core_suite.py:35`; a batch preset that includes `tests/`). The rules
    have no debug-only branches, so games should be identical; measure the gain.
  - Delete code no match or player path reaches, and stop building end-of-day text nobody reads in headless matches,
    each only if digests stay identical.
- **Exclusive profile** on length-weighted games including a long (day 300) one: boot, content validation, map
  generation, opening/closing normalize, each AI phase, AI battles split into payload / fight loop / finalize, scenario
  evaluation, fog, the runner's bookkeeping, and the cost of converting one day's changing state.
- **Baselines:** are GDScript-only games identical on Windows and Linux today? Collect script errors from recent
  batches; an error on a path to be ported is fixed in GDScript first (C++ cannot imitate "abort the function, return a
  default").
- **Foundations:** the rules library layout, flags, server build script, symbol archive, worktree submodule fix.
- **Spike:** move one integer kernel end to end (edit, build on both systems, sync, digest, delete the GDScript loop).
  Chosen: the battle hex search (`BattleRules` `_reachable_empty_hexes`, `_walk_steps_to_target`,
  `_obstacle_field_stays_open`). Battle code is quiet and Phase 1 needs it anyway. It saves less per game than the BFS core
  of `AiHeroRules._search` (`:5508-5702`, up to 13-27 s), but AiHeroRules changes almost daily and would need an
  exemption from the quiet-code rule.

**Gate G0** (thresholds are proposals for the owner):

| Check | Go | Otherwise |
|---|---|---|
| Spike correctness | 0 shadow mismatches on every call in the six seeds; identical daily digests | name the first differing function, do not merge |
| Across compilers | Linux digests equal the Linux GDScript baseline; fixtures identical under MSVC, GCC, MinGW | fix flags; if GDScript itself differs between systems, identity becomes per system |
| Speed per call, boundary included | 20x or more | 5-20x: fix the interface first; under 5x: stop the C++ route |
| Battle share | AI battle work is 20% or more of match CPU, fight loop half of that | under 15%: do overworld phases first, or stop |
| Fixed cost per match | 10% of CPU or less | bring Phase 6's GDScript part forward |
| Developer loop | owner accepts the measured edit-to-local-match and edit-to-push times | owner decides |

### Phase 0 results (measure slice, 2026-10-20)

Measured at 329a8c490 on the owner's machine (16 cores, 32 threads), editor binary unless stated. No owner batch ran;
another project's Godot processes (1-3) ran during the profile, not during the editor/release timing.

- **Parity check** (`tools/rules_parity.py`, `HEROES_AI_MATCH_DIGEST` in the match runner). HEAD against a copy of
  HEAD: identical daily digests and records on all six seeds, 5.3 min at 6 at once. A copy with
  `ATTACK_BONUS_PER_POINT` 0.05 -> 0.0501 differs from day 2-5 per seed, first path `flags.ai_battle_log[3].power`,
  6.4 min including the replays. A run fails when it prints a SCRIPT ERROR line, and the match runner stops at once
  when the native rules library is not registered (`NativeRules.available()`), so two copies broken the same way
  never compare identical. `prepare` registers the prepared revision's own `.gdextension` files.
- **Windows and Linux** (the 4.6.2 Linux editor binary on the server): identical daily digests on all six seeds. The
  match records differ in the 15th significant digit of some floats (`power`, `defender_power`, `survivor_power`,
  `estimated_loss_share`) in five seeds (s2 is byte-identical): the record is written at JSON's default precision, the
  digest at full precision, so the numbers are equal and only their text differs. Compare across systems by digest.
- **Script errors:** none, in the six seeds on both systems and in the nine owner batch folders of 2026-10-17 to
  2026-10-20 (`ai_batch_20261017_*` to `ai_batch_20261020_r7_large4p_60`). Nothing on a path to be ported needs a
  GDScript fix first.
- **Release template.** The 4.6.2 export templates were not installed here (copied from the server into a scratch
  profile for this). Official release templates refuse a scene on the command line (`disable_path_overrides`), so the
  batch presets `Windows AI Batch` and `Linux AI Batch` (the release presets plus `tests/`, feature `ai_batch`) start
  the match runner through `application/run/main_scene.ai_batch` in `project.godot`. The first export takes 3 min,
  later ones 30-40 s, and writes a 4.7 GB pack.
  - Identical to the editor binary on all six seeds: every daily digest and the match record, compared with
    `rules_parity.py --portable`. That flag blanks the 9 kinds of field that hold where the map package was written
    (`res://maps` under the editor, `user://maps` in an export): its paths and the package signatures that include
    them, 68 values on day 1 inside the package keys (`map_package_ref`, `native_random_map_runtime_scenario_record`,
    the provenance and others); the rest of those keys, such as the runtime scenario record's objectives, player
    slots and starting resources, is compared. Nothing else differs on day 1, so the `template_release` native
    library builds the same maps. (Measured with the first version of the flag, which left those keys out whole;
    the 68 values it blanks now are the 68 that differed.)
  - Speed, plain runs of the five profile games below, editor and release side by side (10 at once, nothing else
    running): 2,221 s against 1,840 s, **1.21x** (1.20-1.21x per game), identical records. The six seeds during
    the check: 1.20-1.27x.
  - `tools/ai_match_batch.py --release` exports into `OUT/game`, plays on it and deletes it when the batch
    completes. Owner decision 2026-10-20: the editor binary stays the batch default, `--release` is opt-in. The Linux preset is not tested (the
    server checkout has no import cache to export from).
- **Profile.** Five full-length large 4P land games, the set-ups of owner round 7 (`ai_batch_20261020_r7_large4p_60`
  m011, m044, m053, m013, m054; one or two levels, normal or strong guards) replayed at 329a8c490, where they end on
  days 97, 135, 181, 222 and 320 (cap), 5 at once. Exclusive time per part: a wrapper on each listed function, so a
  part includes the unwrapped helpers it calls. Percent of each process's time (one core per game). The probes cost
  1.1%: the same games uninstrumented take 178, 193, 300, 549 and 965 s and end the same way.

  | **Seconds** | 178 | 195 | 302 | 553 | 981 | 2,210 |

- **G0 numbers.**
  - Battle share: **18.6%** of match CPU over the five games (29.4, 24.2, 23.8, 15.9 and 15.4% per game, falling with
    length), between the Go (20%) and stop (15%) thresholds. 3,911 AI battles (1,938 free-fight checks, 988 previews,
    985 real), 105 ms each on average.
  - Fight loop: **85.6%** of the battle work (rules 5.9 and battle AI 10.0 points of match CPU).
  - Fixed cost per match: **2.8%** (1.8-6.0% per game), 10-17 s per game: boot 3.9 s, content validation 0.8 s, map
    generation 3.1-9.7 s, session start 1.3-1.7 s, record and exit 0.6-1.5 s. Under the 10% threshold.
  - The overworld AI is 72.3% (the AI rows, its sight included); day processing outside it (normalize, player fog,
    scenario, text, the rest of `end_turn`) is 6.0%. Dropping the end-of-day text would save under 0.1%.
- **JSON round trip of one day's changing state** (m054, every day, per top-level key: `JSON.stringify` at full
  precision, then `JSON.parse_string`; a key has changed when its text has). The whole session is 25-30 MB and takes
  1.75 s per day both ways, about 60 ms per MB. 5-7 of its 43 keys change on a day: `flags`, `encounters`,
  `enemy_states`, `towns` and `command_risk_forecast` daily, `resolved_encounters` and `resource_nodes` on 208 and
  139 days. They are 9.9 MB on the median day and cost **0.54 s** per day (0.27 each way), 173 s over the game,
  against 3.0 s of play per day (965 s uninstrumented). Most of `flags` never changes: a 3-6 MB copy of the map
  package record sits beside the growing AI battle log (0.8 MB by day 80 in mg-a). Without that copy, the changing
  state is about 3.6 MB on the median day and 7 MB on day 320. A deep copy (`duplicate(true)`) of the changed keys
  takes 0.10 s per day.

### Phase 0 results (toolchain and spike slice, 2026-10-20)

**Toolchain.** `src/gdextension/rules/` is its own CMake project. It builds the `aurelion_rules_core` static library
(std:: only), the `aurelion_rules` GDExtension (`rules.gdextension`, class `AurelionRules`, `get_build_info()`) and
`rules_selftest`, so rules commits never rebuild the map generator. Both flavours use `/O2 /Ob2 /fp:precise` or
`-O2 -ffp-contract=off`. Other pieces:
- `tools/build_native.py windows|linux` builds here with MSVC, or on the Linux server in a fresh `/tmp` directory at
  nice 19 (GCC 13.3, plus the self-test built with MinGW and run under Wine). Every file comes back sha256-checked, and
  PDBs and Linux debug files are archived per build id outside git (`heroes-like-native-symbols/`). The remote build
  has a deadline (`--remote-timeout`, 120 min); a build that dies without an exit code, a removed directory or an
  unreachable host stops the script, and every failure names the remote directory.
- Exports leave out the debug libraries, PDBs, `rules_selftest` and the rules sources.
- `tools/build_release_candidate.py` (and with it the workflow) builds and tests the release rules library on both
  systems. The release export copies it beside the binary, as it does the map library, so `tools/package_release.py`
  and the Linux and Windows installers carry both libraries (fixed after review: the first push left them expecting
  one). Checked by exporting both release presets: the payload check passes, the pack lists `rules.gdextension`, and
  the exported Windows game loads both libraries.
- Release packaging still stops before the archives, for a reason older than this slice: the export writes a 4.7 GB
  pack, above the 2 GB bound of `tools/compact_export_pck.py` and the 2 GiB archive-member bound of
  `package_release.py`. A headless boot of that export also fails some preloads (a town shader, result textures).
- `tools/core_suite.py` runs `rules_selftest` and fails when a checkout has not registered a `.gdextension`.
- Worktrees take godot-cpp from the main checkout when it is at the pinned commit.

**D3.** The Linux map debug library was rebuilt with the script and stripped: 50.8 MB → 4.2 MB.
- The rebuilt map self-test and CLI are byte-identical to the committed ones.
- The library's read-only strings differ only in embedded source paths.
- The six seeds play identically with the old and the new library on Linux.

**Determinism.** Two checks pass identically under MSVC 19.44 (VS 17.14), GCC 13.3 and MinGW 13 (Wine), with sweep digest
`c6f6ecf4989d40bd`:
- 587 golden vectors carrying their own inputs, picked from 42,019 distinct calls of the GDScript search. The calls
  come from the arena suites, the six seeds, the battle core tests and 70 hand-made obstacle boards.
- A 20,000-board sweep.

**Correctness (G0 row 1).** Shadow mode ran both searches on every call and compared the answers, int/float types
and key order included:

| Run | Calls compared | Mismatches |
|---|---|---|
| Battle AI arena `standard` suite (Windows) | 72,590 | 0 |
| Battle AI arena `holdout` suite (Windows) | 75,286 | 0 |
| Six parity seeds (Linux) | 91,466 | 0 |
| Six parity seeds (Windows) | 91,466 | 0 |

`tools/rules_parity.py` gives identical daily digests and match records for the final native build against main on all
six seeds, on Windows and on Linux (415 game days per system). The core suite passes on both systems.

**Speed per call (G0 row 3).** The captured calls were replayed through the GDScript loop and through the native call
(`PackedByteArray` in, `PackedInt32Array` out), 5 passes, idle machine. The last column comes from the shadow runs
of the six seeds (six games at once). All values are µs per call.

| Search | System | GDScript | Native, boundary included | Native + the game's Dictionaries | Whole function, six seeds (shadow) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `_reachable_empty_hexes` | Windows | 25.2 | 1.44 (17.5x) | 13.6 (1.85x) | 99.7 → 88.2 (1.13x) |
| | Linux | 23.6 | 1.28 (18x) | 11.5 (2.0x) | 91.7 → 79.6 (1.15x) |
| `_walk_steps_to_target` | Windows | 278.6 | 2.97 (94x) | 48.5 (5.7x) | 431.7 → 145.7 (3.0x) |
| | Linux | 246.8 | 2.73 (90x) | 32.3 (7.6x) | 408.5 → 124.5 (3.3x) |
| `_obstacle_field_stays_open` | Windows | 91.3 | 1.63 (56x) | 1.69 (54x) | 118.7 → 7.7 (15x) |
| | Linux | 94.6 | 1.81 (52x) | 1.85 (51x) | 123.5 → 9.4 (13x) |

What the numbers say:
- The search itself crosses the boundary cheaply: 17-94x.
- Turning its answer into the game's format costs more than the search: one Dictionary per cell, or `"q,r"` string
  keys.
- In a game, the GDScript that builds the battle's blocking map before each search costs the most. It stays GDScript
  in this spike and is shared by both columns.
- So the whole-function gain is 1.13x on Windows (1.15x on Linux) for the reachable search and 3.0x (3.3x) for
  the walk.

By the G0 table, the call through the boundary is a go for the walk and field checks and is in "fix the interface
first" for the reachable search. With the Dictionaries, the reachable search falls below 5x. That is the interface
shape Phase 1 removes: battle state and the open mask live natively, and callers read id/step arrays.

**Developer loop (G0 row 6).** Measured on this slice's own changes.
- **Edit to local match: about 25 s.** A one-line change in `battle_hex.cpp` takes 5.1 s for the incremental MSVC
  build of the debug flavour plus the self-test. The small 2P match that follows (seed s2, 33 days) takes 19.3 s. A
  GDScript change skips the 5 s.
- **Edit to push on both systems: about 18 min**, the sum of the measured steps on the critical path below. Commit,
  push and syncing the owner's checkout are not included. The steps:
  - Windows: both flavours 9 s, parity check 5.0 min, core suite 36 s.
  - Linux build on the server: 8-10 min (490-584 s). It runs in parallel with the Windows steps. The script builds in a
    fresh directory every time, so godot-cpp compiles twice; a persistent remote build tree would avoid that (not
    measured).
  - Linux checks: upload 35 s, the six seeds 5.5 min per side on its 4 cores, core suite 58 s. Comparing against main's
    digests from an earlier run saves the second side; running main too adds about 6 min (24 min in all).
- **For comparison:** a GDScript port change needs only the Windows parity check and core suite: 5.6 min.

### Gate G0 result (owner, 2026-10-20): passed

Row by row, after an independent review of both slices and its fixes (8b9adbdb6, bd8d2ddf0, 26f83c7d4,
7ccb4bf9b): spike correctness and compilers are Go; per call through the boundary the walk and field checks are Go and
the reachable search is in "fix the interface first", which Phase 1 does by keeping battle state native; the battle
share (18.6%, between the 15% and 20% thresholds) and the developer loop were accepted by the owner; fixed cost is Go.
Expected gain, from the profile: battles alone bound whole games at about 1.23x (1.18x on the longest games); Phase 2's
battle tool serves battle-level balance work; the large whole-game gain needs the overworld AI (72.3%), Phases 3-5.
Release packaging still stops on the 4.7 GB export pack, which predates the rules library.

### Phase 1: native battle engine, one merge

- **Scope:** the rules part of BattleRules, all of BattleAiRules, in-battle SpellRules, BattleAutoResolveRules,
  BattleFootprint, BattleDamageRules, TownBattleRules, the order-by-order API for battles the player fights, and the UI
  queries. Events become structured records turned into today's strings by a GDScript formatter (exactly, or excluded
  only with owner approval, because presentation events are saved state in player battles). About 6k lines of
  `describe_*` stay GDScript.
- **Boundary:** a `BattleEngine` class: `resolve(battle, caster_profiles, step_limit, stop_below)` replacing the loop in
  `BattleAutoResolveRules.gd:147`; `apply_player_order`, `cast_player_spell`, `move_active_stack_to_hex`,
  `drain_enemy_turns`; queries for legal hexes, approach cells, damage ranges, turn-order forecast and the Auto decision.
  The combat seed, obstacles and `_finalize_*` stay GDScript in this phase.
- **Order:** hex geometry, damage (the multiplier chain in exact order), movement, turn order and effects, attacks and
  the 22 abilities, cohesion and momentum, town defences, in-battle spells, enemy turns and battle AI, autoplay.
- **Checkpoint G1** after the hex, damage, movement and turn layers: the native loop, conversion included, is 10x or
  more faster on the tuner's corpus. Under 5x: fix the interface before porting the AI part.
- **Identity:** per-action stream (order taken, RNG state and roll count, simulation-key digest) on the tuner suites,
  every AI battle in the six seeds, and JSON round-tripped payloads; shadow mode on every resolve; daily digests; the
  payload corpus across compilers; mid-battle save/load both ways between the native build and the tagged pre-merge
  build; every battle UI query compared in shadow mode on the human-seat corpus.
- **Exit:** all battles native, the GDScript fight loop and BattleAiRules deleted, every deleted name grepped across
  `tests/` and `tools/` (`core_script_compile_check` covers only `scripts/` and `scenes/`), the runner and tuner run,
  core suite on Windows and Linux, project.md ownership updated.
- **Gain:** large for battle-only work (the tuner); modest for whole games, bounded by the battle share from Phase 0.

### Phase 2: one payload builder, AI preview as one call, the battle tool

- Battle payload creation (`BattleRules.gd:256-402`), stack and hero payloads, obstacles, and the end-of-battle numbers
  (survivors, experience, recovery, level-ups, `army_power`) move native; every payload caller switches.
- `AiHeroRules._simulate_battle` becomes one native call with no scratch session, if shadow mode proves the read-back
  fields identical.
- Transcendental math first appears here (`army_power`, `HeroProgressionRules.gd:646`): decision D4.
- `battle_sim_cli` (or an in-Godot threaded runner, decision D7) becomes a backend for `tune.py` and `arena.py`.
- **Gate G2:** a battles-per-second target the owner sets (the synthesis proposes 1M battles in 2 h on this machine).
  **Battle-level genetic algorithms (unit stats, battle-AI weights) run at full speed from here.**

### Phase A: overworld AI numbers into data (GDScript only, any time after G0)

The tuning numbers among the 99 constants at `AiHeroRules.gd:26-297`, and inline literals, move to `content/ai_hero_weights.json`, with weight
sets per controller. Proof: identical digests with every controller on the default set. AI number tuning then needs no
code edit, before or after the AI goes native, and a genetic algorithm can give each seat its own genome.

### Phase 3: overworld kernels by rule

A kernel moves only if it is 3% or more of match CPU, takes packed arrays and scalars, uses no transcendental math, hash
or RNG, and had no behaviour commit for 7 days. Candidates: `_level_surface`, `_war_paths`, fog `_explored`/`_reveal`.

### Gate G3: re-plan from measurements

Re-estimate Phases 4-7 from Phase 1's measured rate (lines per day, mismatches per 1,000 lines). If AiHeroRules had
behaviour commits on more than 4 of the last 14 days, do Phase 5 before Phase 4, keeping the AI in GDScript longer. The
owner decides whether to continue toward whole-game speed.

### Phase 4: the overworld AI faction turn

AiHeroRules, the AI paths of EnemyAdventureRules and EnemyTurnRules, and the rule functions they reach. One native
`run_faction_turn` per faction turn: load a view of the session, run, patch back, clear caches. Functions with human or
UI callers keep a thin GDScript wrapper. Must reproduce sort ties, first-wins comparisons on float scores, `stops.keys()`
order, the tavern and spawn RNG, and the decision and battle logs. Proof adds a codec round trip
(`to_dict(from_dict(d)) == d` with types and key order) on every day of the six seeds and on owner-approved save copies.
AI code is frozen during the slice; the Phase A numbers stay open.

### Phase 5: day processing

`normalize_overworld_state`, `commit_active_hero`, town occupation and recovery, income, growth, reserve deliveries,
`PlayerEliminationRules.apply_daily`, `ScenarioRules.evaluate_session`, and `_finalize_*` for human battles: one native
call per day. The end-turn confirmation dry run in `OverworldShell.gd:1464-1529` must invalidate native caches too.

### Phase 6: match throughput

The runner keeps a native session handle across days and writes Dictionaries back only for the digest and record (with
a check that runner mode and game mode give the same digests); several matches per Godot process (match N identical in a
reused and a fresh process); a pre-generated map corpus for genetic-algorithm work. The GDScript parts do not need C++
and move forward if G0 finds a high fixed cost. **Whole-game genetic algorithms become practical here, if the measured
gain is there.**

### Phase 7: human-side actions and the last GDScript rules

Movement, routes, context actions, overworld spells, town actions, hero transfers and artifact equipping: about 378
functions the UI calls, at 1,221 call sites. Needed for the one-copy end state, not for speed, so it can interleave with
other work. Merging the separate human and AI forms of heroes, treasury and fog is a later save-schema slice.

### Phase 8 (optional): a match runner without Godot

The same core as a command-line tool. Needs the copied Variant hash and either deterministic math or accepted last-bit
differences against the game.

### Totals

Sizes are the proposal's unmeasured agent-day guesses, useful only to compare phases (see section 6).

| Up to | Size guess (unmeasured) | What it buys |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | 6-12 (measured: 2 h 20 min, two sessions) | a measured go/no-go, cheap GDScript levers |
| Phases 1-2 | 44-88 more | battle-level genetic algorithms at native speed |
| Phases A, 3 | 2-19 more | AI numbers as data; some overworld kernels |
| Phases 4-6 | 49-100 more | whole-game speed (the large gain) |
| Phase 7 | 35-70 more | one copy of every rule |

## 7. AI and balance changes during the transition

| Change | Policy |
|---|---|
| Content JSON balance | Always open; the native tables rebuild per content revision. |
| Battle-AI weights (`content/battle_ai_weights.json`) | Always open; per side; much faster to tune from Phase 2. |
| Overworld AI numbers | Open; data per controller after Phase A. |
| Battle rule or battle-AI code | Frozen during Phase 1. An urgent fix lands in GDScript on main, is ported on the branch and passes shadow mode again. After Phase 1 it is a C++ change in its own commit. |
| Overworld AI code | GDScript and open until Phase 4; frozen only during its slice. |
| New unit abilities | C++ changes after Phase 1. |
| Comparing AI code variants | Build `battle_sim_cli` from two git revisions under a namespace macro; nothing extra on main. |

## 8. Owner decisions

| | Decision | When |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **Decided 2026-10-20:** `project.md:49` records the move to C++ subsystem by subsystem; the ownership list changes as each phase lands | before Phase 0 code |
| D2 | **Decided 2026-10-20:** parity runs are allowed on port slices, never while an owner batch is running (AGENTS.md "Validation budget") | Phase 0 |
| D3 | **Decided 2026-10-20:** native binaries stay committed; the Linux debug library is stripped (50.8 MB today) and its debug info kept outside git | Phase 0 |
| D4 | Math: engine math through godot-cpp in the game, or a later deterministic-math behaviour change | Phase 2 |
| D5 | **Phase 1 decided 2026-10-20:** battle-rule and battle-AI code take no behaviour changes from the start of Phase 1 to its merge; an urgent fix lands in GDScript on main and is ported on the branch; content JSON and `battle_ai_weights.json` stay open (AGENTS.md "Native rules port"). AI code: decided before Phase 4 | before each |
| D6 | **Decided 2026-10-20:** tests that call private battle functions the port deletes are retired at the Phase 1 merge by the `docs/rmg-test-retirement.md` process; the parity corpus and the core suite cover battles | Phase 1 |
| D7 | Whether a tool built from the same core counts under "no simulator outside Godot" (`PLAN.md:328`), or an in-Godot threaded runner instead | Phase 2 |
| D8 | **Decided 2026-10-20:** Phase 1 lives on one port branch, `native-phase1-battle` on GitHub, rebased on main at least weekly and before each slice, and merges to main once, when every battle is native and identical; it is dropped if checkpoint G1 stays under 5x after the interface fix (AGENTS.md "Native rules port") | Phase 1 |
| D9 | Where owner-save copies for the codec proof live (outside git); asked when a slice first needs owner saves | Phase 1 |
| D10 | **Decided 2026-10-20:** main is tagged before each port merge, and the merged subsystem takes no behaviour commits for 7 days after it | each merge |

## 9. Risks and how the plan contains them

- **Parity debugging eats the schedule.** Finest-checkpoint diffing, the three-strikes blocker rule, and G1/G3 re-plans
  from measured rates.
- **The AI changes faster than it can be ported.** The AI stays GDScript until the order rule allows it; its numbers
  move to data first.
- **Builds compete with batches for the machine.** Builds on the server or CI at low priority; batches from a frozen
  `bin/` copy.
- **A native crash takes the game down.** Copy-in/copy-out calls, caught exceptions, input capture, archived symbols.
- **Saves strand after a revert.** No subsystem version bump inside a port slice (`damage_rng_version`,
  `ai_heroes_version`); two-way save tests at every merge.
- **Engine upgrades.** The copied helpers are tied to Godot 4.6.2 and godot-cpp is pinned to `10.0.0-rc1`; any bump
  re-runs the helper fuzz and full parity. Move godot-cpp to a release tag before rules ship.
- **A stopped phase leaves dead code.** If a gate says stop, delete whatever no live path uses.

## 10. Brief for each port slice

The exact functions to port (from Phase 0's executed-function list), every caller in `scenes/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` and
`tools/`, the boundary signature, the corpus and parity commands, the freeze notice, what is forbidden (redesign, fixes
inside port commits, builds or parity runs during an owner batch), the blocker format, and "done": native code runs in
the game, the GDScript is deleted, callers are updated, parity is identical, the core suite passes on Windows and Linux,
cleanup is done. Slices are cut small enough for an agent to hold their functions in context; BattleRules alone is 16k
lines.

## 11. To verify in Phase 0 before relying on this plan

Godot 4.6.2 internals (PCG bounded draw, `randf` width and draw count, String hash, `SortArray`, JSON float parsing);
the C runtime of the official Windows binary; Windows/Linux identity of GDScript games today; whether caster profiles
stay constant through a battle; which presentation keys nothing reads in AI battles; whether release templates run the
match scene with identical results; the exclusive time split on full-length games. Measured so far (Phase 0 results):
Windows/Linux identity, release templates, the time split.
